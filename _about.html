    <p>I've been working in software development for 20 years. After graduate school where I focused on image compression algorithm development, I worked for various science and techology companies, including 2rye, Carbon Five, Xmarks, BEA Systems, Symyx Technologies, and FAST Search. On the side, I help run Mission Artists United, an artists driven community which supports and promotes artists in the Mission District of the San Francisco.</p>
    <p>I've contributed to the open source community with a couple of ruby gems (<a href="https://github.com/2rye/qr4r">qr code generation in ruby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/2rye/rosie">rosie, a sql/asset backup system</a>), and by adding bits of code to several external open source projects.</p>
    <p>After several years of contracting, I've signed up for a regular nine-to-five working with a great team of folks at <a href="http://www.carbonfive.com">Carbon Five</a>.  So for a while, I will not be available for contract work</p>
