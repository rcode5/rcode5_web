    <p>I've been working in software development for 20 years. After graduate school where I focused on image compression algorithm development, I worked for various science and techology companies, including 2rye, Carbon Five, Xmarks, BEA Systems, Symyx Technologies, and FAST Search. On the side, I help run Mission Artists United an artists driven community which supports and promotes artists in the Mission District of the San Francisco.</p>
    <p>I've contributed to the open source community with a couple of ruby gems (<a href="https://github.com/2rye/qr4r">qr code generation in ruby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/2rye/rosie">rosie, a sql/asset backup system</a>), and by adding bits of code to several external open source projects.</p>
    <p>I'm available for contract web application work.  Though I typically lean towards ruby based projects, I've had experience in many other languages and am willing to entertain most any project.  Please drop me a line at and let's see if I can help you out with your next project.  <a href="#" onclick="javascript:mailer('jon','rcode5.com') && false;">jon at rcode5 dot com</a></p>
