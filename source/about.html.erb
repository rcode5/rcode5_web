    <p>I've been working in software development for ~25 years. After graduate school where I focused
      on image compression algorithm development, I worked for various science and
      techology companies, including 2rye, Carbon Five, Xmarks,
       BEA Systems, Symyx Technologies, and FAST Search.
       On the side, I help run Mission Artists United, an artists driven community which
       supports and promotes artists in the Mission District of the San Francisco.</p>
    <p>I've contributed to the open source community with a couple of ruby gems
      s(<a href="https://github.com/2rye/qr4r">qr code generation in ruby</a>,
       <a href="https://github.com/2rye/rosie">rosie, a sql/asset backup system</a>),
       and by adding bits of code to several external open source projects.</p>
    <p>I'm currently in a Senior Staff role at Gusto.</p>
